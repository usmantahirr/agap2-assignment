# AGAP2 Assignment
## Power Puff Girls series details

To install, test and run project, run the following commands

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

This project use API's from [TV Maze](https://api.tvmaze.com/)

## Problem Statement:

We would like to see a small web app with two pages (routes): a details page for the TV show "Powerpuff Girls", and an episode detail page with information about specific episodes.

### Page 1:
The TV show page should at least display the following information (you're free to add more)
- Show title
- Show Description
- Show cover image
- Episode list. Every episode in the list should link to a details page for that specific episode

### Page 2:
The episode detail page should contain at least:
• Episode-title
• Episode Summary
• Episode cover image

API: http://www.tvmaze.com/api

### Requirements:
- Setup two routes in your app, one for TV shows and one for episodes.
- Retrieve data from TV Maze REST API.
- Use of typescript.
- Use React to render UI components.
- Use "Create React App" to bootstrap your project.
- Use of react-hooks.
- Do not leave any unused dependencies or scripts
- Setup state management - redux - and data flow.
- Style your components with css-in-js, make sure that the end result is responsive and has at least one breakpoint.
- All code should be checked-in into a Git repository.
- Documentation is optional but appreciated, the same goes for comments in your code.

### Nice to have:
If you feel you have time to express yourself more here's the list of few points to guide you:
- Add unit and snapshot tests.
- URL where the app can be viewed and seen working (use any platform of your preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)

### Evaluation points:
- use of community best practices
- use of clean code which is self-documenting
- use of domain driven design
- tests for business logic
- clean and extendable project structure, usage of best practices
- use of css-in-js
- use of design frameworks
- use of code quality checkers such as linters and build tools
- use of git with appropriate commit messages
- documentation: README and inline code comment
